    <p>My main aim in *RS School* is to get as much experience in front-end development as possible. On the 4-th year of studying in Economic University I found programming very interesting. Much more interesting, than economics! So I started exploring this sphere and decided, that *RS School* would be a great helper for me as a newbie in achieving my goals. In future I'm going to become a true and serious web-developer, who is always in trend and knows all the innovations in the world of web-development.</p>
